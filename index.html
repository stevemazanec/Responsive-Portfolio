            As our world becomes increasingly connected and dependent on the internet, I wanted to learn more about how it all fit together,
            so I decided to learn to become a web developer. It's challenging but rewarding to peak behind the curtain and
            learn how these things work. One of the coolest things about it is that the more I learn about it, the more I
            discover there is to learn about it!

            When I'm not working on code, I love cheering on the Indians, Cavs, and (painfully) even the Browns. I've had the privilege
            of attending 2 World Series games, 1 NBA finals game, but never a Super Bowl. Needless to say, it may be awhile
            until I get to check that one off of my bucket list. I'm also a big fan of running, as I find it's a great way
            to stay healthy and relieve stress. I've completed four half marathons and hope to run more in the future. One
            of my favorite things about running is that the competition and the drive are all internal. I'm only competing
            against myself and my previous fastest times, so motivation is a huge key to succeeding.
